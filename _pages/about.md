I am a civil engineer and amateur, hobbyist programmer, originating from Greece, now living in Switzerland. I received my *Diploma in Civil Engineering* from **Democritus University of Thrace** with a specialisation in structural engineering, followed by a *Master of Science degree in Civil Engineering* at the **Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH)**. During my studies in Greece I took advantage of the Erasmus Placement Programme opportunity and worked as an intern for a medium sized civil engineer office in Austria. At ETH, I continued my specialisation in structural engineering, with an emphasis in ***Conceptual design of structures***, ***Computer aided methods for solving complicated structural systems*** and ***Structural Optimisation***. Furthermore, my second specialisation at ETH allowed me to work in sustainability related topics, such as ***Integrated solutions for project planning with Building Information Modelling*** and ***Life Cycle Assessment/Costing***. Moreover, I worked as a Junior Research Assistant at the Steel, Timber and Composite Structures Laboratory of ETH, delivering a series of 6 two-hour Colloquia to Bachelor students for the Steel Structures 2 course. During my Master Thesis at ETH I got strongly involved in programming, and more precisely with ***Python***, which strongly raised my interest in the branch. My work was to develop an optimization framework for a revolutionary, ground-based, Gamma-Ray telescope, working together with a group of astrophysicists from the Institute of Particle Physics at ETH. My main goal is my involvement in exciting, challenging, out-of-the-box projects in the sector of structural engineering.
