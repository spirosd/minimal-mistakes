I am a civil engineer and amateur, hobbyist programmer, originating from Greece, now living in Switzerland. I received my *Diploma in Civil Engineering* from **Democritus University of Thrace** with a specialisation in structural engineering, followed by a *Master of Science degree in Civil Engineering* at the **Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH)**. There, I continued my specialisation in structural engineering, with an emphasis in ***Steel Structures***, ***Statics*** and ***Computer aided methods for solving structural systems***. Furthermore, my second specialisation at ETH allowed me to work in sustainability related topics, ranging from ***Whole Building Analysis*** to ***Life Cycle Assessment/Costing*** under ***Building Information Modelling*** processes. During my Master Thesis I got involved with ***Python***, developing an optimization framework for a revolutionary, ground-based, Gamma-Ray telescope, along with a group of astrophysicists from the Institute of Particle Physics at ETH. Right now I am in search of my first steps in the industry, with main goal my involvement in exciting, challenging, out-of-the-box projects in the sector of structural engineering.
