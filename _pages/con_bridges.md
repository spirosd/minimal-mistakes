During the last semester of my studies in DUTH, in the scope of the structural engineering specialization, I was involved along with my colleague [Evripidis Apostolidis](https://gr.linkedin.com/in/evripidis-apostolidis-357619bb) in the design of a pre-stressed concrete road bridge.

The project included the total bridge dimensioning, from the geometry to the pre-stressing concept and the reinforcement design. The structural was realized using pre-stressed beams in the longitudinal direction, whereas on the transverse direction the spans were gaped with normal reinforcement.

The loads and load cases were defined according to the Eurocode 0 and 1, and appropriate bearings were defined from the Mageba catalogue.

The cross-section design of the main beams, as well as the plate simulation and internal forces were defined with the help of an appropriate Finite Element program (Risa 3D and Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis Professional).
